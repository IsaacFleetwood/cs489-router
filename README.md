# Custom Router Project

## Introduction
This project is an implementation of a **custom router** built from scratch. It processes network packets, routes traffic, and manages basic networking functions such as IP forwarding, DHCP, NAT, and ARP handling.

## Features
- **IPv4 Routing** – Forward packets between different network interfaces.
- **TCP/UDP/ICMP Handling** – Basic transport layer packet processing.
- **DHCP Server** – Assigns IP addresses dynamically.
- **ARP Server** – Manages MAC-to-IP address mappings.
- **NAT (Network Address Translation)** – Enables multiple devices to share a single public IP.
- **Packet Logging** – Captures and analyzes network traffic.
